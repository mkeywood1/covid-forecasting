# covid-forecasting

## Utilising Real World Data, can we look at forecasting cases, and also clustering States into similar characteristics of their COVID-19 profile?

**NOTE: After this project was done, COVID-19 progressed at a devastating rate, effecting the lives of millions in tragic and deeply upsetting ways. This project was not meant to trivialise COVID-19 but in fact to try and help people understand the onslaught of data they were starting to see.
I put it together at the start of the first UK lockdown, but the UK data was not as available as US data and so for illustrative purposes this focused on the US.**

This started as a personal project but we went on to take what I had started and used the data to do some more advanced forecasting and analytics for commercial uses.

So what did I start with in my personal project?
